# Inventory-Management-System

This project is an inventory management system created to showcase object oriented programming and a Model-View-Controller architecture utilizing Java and JavaFX. The source code contains documentation to generate a javadoc for the model and controller directories. The model and controller classes were created in the Jetbrains Intellij IDE Community Edition while the view directory was largely generated in Scenebuilder.
