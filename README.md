# Inventory-Management-System

This project is an inventory management system created to showcase object oriented programming and a Model-View-Controller architecture utilizing Java and JavaFX. The source code contains documentaation to generate a java doc for the model and controller directories. The model and controller classes were created in the Jetbrains Intellij IDE Community Edition while the view directory was largely generated in Scenebuilder.
